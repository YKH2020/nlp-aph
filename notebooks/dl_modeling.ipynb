      "It's important to note that Asperger syndrome (AS) is no longer considered a separate diagnosis from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In the past, these terms were used differently, but according to modern diagnostic criteria, they are now both classified under ASD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The changes were made in 2013 when the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was published by the American Psychiatric Association. Before this, Asperger's syndrome was seen as a unique condition characterized by significant social and communication difficulties, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior or interests, but with normal or even above-average intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key differences that were often attributed to Asperger's syndrome compared to classic autism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Communication Skills**: Individuals with Asperger's syndrome typically have well-developed verbal skills and can use language in a sophisticated manner. They may struggle more with social aspects of communication, such as non-verbal cues, sarcasm, or figurative language.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Social Interaction**: People with Asperger's were often described as having \"special interests\" rather than repetitive behaviors. Their areas of interest could be quite intense and focused, but they might not display the same level of restricted and repetitive behaviors seen in other forms of autism. They may also have more difficulty understanding social norms and expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intellectual Abilities**: Many individuals with Asperger's syndrome are highly intelligent or have average to above-average intelligence. This is in contrast to some forms of autism where intellectual disability is more common.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Language Development**: While language development may be delayed slightly, children with Asperger's often reach typical milestones and can even exhibit advanced vocabulary at a young age.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's crucial to understand that these distinctions were based on observed behaviors and symptoms rather than underlying causes or brain function. The changes in diagnosis reflect a growing understanding that autism exists on a spectrum, with varying strengths and challenges in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior across all individuals diagnosed with ASD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, healthcare professionals diagnose individuals using the criteria outlined in the DSM-5, which groups together various forms of autism under the umbrella term Autism Spectrum Disorder. The focus is now on supporting individuals with ASD based on their specific needs and strengths rather than distinguishing between different types of autism.\n"

      "Based on the provided context, here are the key differences between Asperger's syndrome (also known as \"high-functioning autism\") and classic Kanner's autism:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Speech Development**: Children with Asperger's syndrome have more normal speech development compared to those with Kanner's autism.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cognitive Skills**: Asperger's children often have much better cognitive skills than those with Kanner's autism.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Clumsiness**: Asperger's children are often clumsy, which is not typically seen in classic autism.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regression**: Children diagnosed with Kanner's autism may start to develop normal speech and social behavior but then regress and lose their speech after age two, while this regression is not typically seen in Asperger's syndrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the broader field of opinion on the relationship between autism and Asperger's: There are differing views within the autism community about whether they are truly separate syndromes or simply different spectrum manifestations of autism. Some argue that the distinction is more about the severity of symptoms rather than fundamentally different conditions.\n"
