# Compliance Documentation

This document outlines the compliance considerations for the Autism Parent Helper (APH) application.

## Data Privacy

### User Data

The Autism Parent Helper (APH) application processes user queries and maintains conversation history. The following measures are in place to protect user privacy:

- Conversation history is stored locally in a `.summary.txt` file
- No personally identifiable information (PII) is explicitly collected
- Users can clear conversation history at any time using the "Clear Memory" function

### Knowledge Base Data

The knowledge base used by the application is built from published literature on autism. This data is:

- Non-personal in nature
- Properly attributed to original sources
- Used for educational and support purposes

## Accessibility

The application aims to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities:

- The Streamlit interface is designed to work with screen readers
- Text-based interactions are the primary mode of communication
- High contrast and readable fonts are used throughout the interface

## Ethical Considerations

### Information Accuracy

The application uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate information based on authoritative sources. This approach:

- Reduces the risk of hallucinated or incorrect information
- Grounds responses in published literature
- Provides context-relevant information

### Disclaimer

The application should include a clear disclaimer that:

- It is not a substitute for professional medical advice
- Information provided is educational in nature
- Users should consult healthcare professionals for specific medical concerns

## Regulatory Compliance

### Healthcare Information

While the application provides information related to autism, it:

- Does not provide medical diagnosis
- Does not prescribe treatments
- Does not store protected health information (PHI)

As such, it may not fall under HIPAA regulations, but caution should be exercised.

### AI Transparency

In accordance with emerging AI regulations:

- The application clearly identifies itself as an AI assistant
- Sources of information are traceable to the knowledge base
- The system's capabilities and limitations are documented

## Security Measures

### Data Protection

- AWS services are configured according to security best practices
- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
- Local data storage is minimal and can be cleared by users

### API Security

- AWS API access is controlled through IAM permissions
- Local LLM API is restricted to localhost by default
- No external API keys are exposed in the application code

## Continuous Compliance

To maintain compliance over time:

- Regularly review and update the knowledge base with current information
- Monitor changes in relevant regulations and standards
- Update security measures as new vulnerabilities are discovered
- Collect and address user feedback related to accuracy and ethical concerns
